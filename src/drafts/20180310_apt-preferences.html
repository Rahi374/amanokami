<h1>APT Preferences</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Soon after I converted to Debian (from Windows, like 6 years ago), one of my big
complaints was that the software was outdated. Sure, Debian is supposed to be
very stable, but for desktop users (as opposed to server), up-to-date software
is a big want. A rolling-release distribution might be the solution, but I don't
think that Arch or Gentoo are good choices for someone straight out of Windows-land.
And really, who wants to use Ubuntu?

<h2>What about Debian Unstable?</h2>

There does exist a release of Debian that is rolling-release, and that is the
unstable or sid "release". You certainly do get the most cutting-edge software,
but the problem that I see is that it's too cutting-edge. As far as I've seen,
Arch's packages are more stable than Debian unstable.

The other issue is that Debian was designed to be upgraded through releases.
This means that if an unstable system hasn't been upgraded or touched for a
release or two, then it might not be able to update. An example of this is when
I got a Pandebian image for the Openpandora that was built in 2011, and I couldn't
do anything related to apt because the dpkg back on 2011 couldn't handle xz data
