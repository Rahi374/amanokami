<h1> Untitled </h1>

I looked back on this blog after I rebuilt the build system and I thought to myself:
what is this blog even for? I'm not an expert in the things that I'm writing about.
I don't even have the right writing skills to make appealing posts that introduce the
few cool things that I know more than the average person. I eventually came to feel
embarrased by the audacity of my previous posts that lacked knowledge and insight.

Now that I think back to it, I saw people like Eric Raymond and Steve Yegge, who
wrote lots of intellectual yet entertaining pieces and perhaps I wanted to be like
them.

In a job interview a few weeks back, the interviewer showed and told me that their
company focuses on producing content; meaning that they have lots of good writers
and only need a few programmers. When I told him that I have a website too but not
with too good written pieces he explained that I specialized more in programming
and less in writing.

But sometimes I do run into cool things that I want to share!
