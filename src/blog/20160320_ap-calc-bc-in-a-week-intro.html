      So at school I take AP Calculus AB (since I already finished IB Math SL last year), but I'm taking the BC exam so I have to cover the BC material on my own, and it's spring break now so perfect studying time. I thought it would be cool to document my progress. Or at least my notes. Not too sure if that's a good idea or not, but ah well.

      Also, I'm using Barron's book (AP Calculus), 13th edition, and I'm only going to do the BC sections. In 4 or 5 days!

      Basically it'll be reading and then note-taking. Also I have a Casio fx-CG 20 calculator, so I get a bunch of easy features that the TI-84 doesn't get, so if I introduce some function and you don't have it on your TI, too bad!
