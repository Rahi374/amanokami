      I was going to write about my HTML5 UI testing and a Japanese USB-ethernet adapter driver setup and about Ruby and Sinatra and Node, but my current method of writing this blog is getting really... annoying. org-page is really nice and convenient in that I can write in org and then it generates pages with tags and RSS and constructs an index page and all that, but it's really difficult and annoying to deal with the git pushing, uploading pictures, and in general it's very difficult to deal with the directory structure of the site.

      Therefore, I'm going to spend the next... arbitrary amount of time to remodel the site.
