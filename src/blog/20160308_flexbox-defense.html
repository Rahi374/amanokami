<h1>Web: Learning Flexbox with games</h1>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-1">Flexbox Defense</h2>

      So I was scrolling down Twitter when I noticed this game: Flexbox Defense! It's a tower defense game where you use flexbox CSS rules to position the defense towers.

    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, one could simply read the documentation for flexbox rules, but I feel like this game is a really good way to learn, since it's fun and you get practice!

      It covers <code>justify-content</code>, <code>align-items</code>, <code>flex-direction</code>, <code>order</code>, and <code>align-self</code>.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-2">Flexbox Froggy</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
    <p>

    </p>


    <p>
      A bit of reading and I found out that this was based on Flexbox Froggy, which it quite good too. It has slightly less flashy graphics, but it has more levels and covers more properties: <code>flex-wrap</code>, <code>flex-flow</code>, and <code>align-content</code> (in addition to the ones Flexbox Defense overs).

    <p>
      I hope there are more games to learn CSS with.

      I realize this is a short post but I wanted to share this finding. I also wanted to test out uploading images through org-page. And I need to do something about Disqus not working...

      UPDATE: (2016-03-09) I got the images working! Also realized I forgot to add links so I'm going to do that now.
