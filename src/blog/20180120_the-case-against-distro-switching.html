<h1>The Case Against Distro Switching: Debian</h1>

<blockquote cite="http://kmkeen.com/maintainers-matter">
  <p> Another wrong answer is the change distros because the grass is greener. If you are not happy with your distro the solution is always the same: become more active in it. All of the aggressively-self-correcting mechanisms are powered by disappointment. Channel yours productively.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Yeah, that quote really sums it up. Rather than switching distros,
make your distro work the way that you want. This means that the only
difference between the distros is the driving philosophy behind it.

<p> Even the package manager and the package repos no longer become a
difference. Once you grok your distro, then <b>anything</b> related to
the construction and presence of packages no longer matters. Package
doesn't exist in the repo? Package it yourself, the same way the
packagers/maintainers do it! Want source-based package management in a
binary-only distro? Repackage it and maybe script the repackaging!
Want binary-based package management in a source-only distro? Create
your own binary repo and package packages for it! Become a maintainer
while you're at it.

<p> Which means that, I think, that distro wars no longer matter,
and that all distros, in their technical aspects, are equal.
I have heard many people give a chuckle or be condescending when they
hear I use Debian, and be impressed or satisfied when they hear others
use Arch.

<p> This comparison is the most common around me. The thing is, I like both, but I made the choice of Debian. I think that at this point I have enough Debian experience to bend a system to my will while conforming to The
Debian Way. Therefore, I have made it my goal to use Debian in a way such
that if someone says that Arch (or any other distro) is better because X,
I can say "so can Debian". Maybe it doesn't do it as good as the other
distro, like reproducible systems of NixOS/GuixSD, but it can be done.

<p> So I know that what I intended is distro-agnostic, but I will show
how I am managing to do it with Debian. After all, Debian is
<i>The Universal Operating System</i>. The rest is my story.

<h2>My Story</h2>

<p> I spent a large chunk of last semester trying to choose a distro to
switch to (not hop!). It started when I first found out about NixOS and
was amazed at how you could just declare <i>everything</i> about the
system and then that would act as a recipe for the system. I always had
this fear of having to rebuild my main computer from a fresh install and
wanted such simple reproducibility and so I was considering switching to
NixOS.

<p> There were other alternatives I was considering as well:
<ul>
  <li> <b>NixOS</b>
  <li> <b>GuixSD</b> - for the same reason as NixOS, but unfortunately
    I need my non-free wireless card firmware
  <li> <b>Gentoo</b> - maybe I could try a source-based distro
  <li> <b>Sourcemage</b> - same
  <li> <b>Arch</b> - I've had good experiences and I just kinda like it
  <li> <b>Void</b> - like Arch but also not like Arch, plus it's both binary and source!
  <li> <b>Alpine</b> - I like that minimalism
</ul>

And with so many choices I now had to actually figure out what I really
wanted in a distro, and choose the one with the best balance.

<p> So I eventually came up with a list of things I wanted in a distro:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Reproducilibity of the system</b> (or at least packages, from a recipe)
    <ul><li>Satisfied by: NixOS, GuixSD</ul>
  <li> <b>Minimalist package manager</b> (so if I get an embedded system for example, I can plop the package manager binary in there and have it work)
    <ul><li>Satisfied by: Alpine (?) Gentoo (?)</ul>
  <li> <b>Both binary and source based package managing</b>
    <ul><li>Satisfied by: Void, Gentoo (kinda), NixOS (I think)</ul>
  <li> <b>Supports many architectures</b> (uniformity across devices - although really we only need i386, arm64 and armhf)
    <ul>
      <li>Satisfied by: Debian, Gentoo, Alpine
      <li>Main three: GuixSD, Arch (unofficial), Void
    </ul>
</ul>

I'm not going to delve into the pros and cons of each distro.

<p> From these, the distro with the highest "score" is Gentoo.
I decided that it would be good to know how to do a Gentoo install
and basic usage so I tried (in a VM) and it was interesting and fun,
but rebuilding that @world set? All the time? Not my cup of tea.

<p> So my pondering bounced back and forth between these few distros,
and by the time winter break rolled around (prime time for distro
switching!), I had narrowed it down to Gentoo, Arch, and Void. I threw
NixOS out the window because it was huge pain to install custom kernels
on it and I couldn't find helpful documentation. GuixSD lacked non-free
wireless card firmware. Alpine's musl was causing problems for some of
my other things.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p> In the end though, I decided against switching. One reason is that
I got lazy, but the real reason is that I read the essay that I quoted
earlier, and was inspired such that I looked back at Debian and noticed
that it satisfied all my wants. They don't advertise it that way and
people certainly don't talk about it, but if you dig just a bit deeper,
you can find it there.

<ul>
  <li> <b>Reproducilibity of the system</b> -- at least packages
    <div class="code-container">
      <span>$ dpkg --get-selections | grep -P "\tinstall" > package-list</span>
      <span># apt-get install $(cat package-list)</span>
      <span>+ etckeeper</span>
    </div>
  <li> <b>Minimalist package manager</b>
    <ul><li>Turns out embedded systems have opkg already, or
        it's buildroot so it has no package manager</ul>
  <li> <b>Both binary and source based package managing</b>
    <ul><li>Turns out I didn't actually need the source part, except for the
        occasional package that I wanted to compile myself, or
        I need to build it myself because it's not in the repos</ul>
    <div class="code-container">
      <span>$ make</span>
      <span>$ sudo checkinstall</span>
    </div>
  <li> <b>Supports many architectures</b>
    <ul><li>We already know this</ul>
</ul>

<p>To me, the most surprising was that apt is capable of doing both
binary and source based package management. It's not super sophisticated
like Gentoo or Sourcemage's package managers, but I'm not super keen on
having to compile literally everything, so apt's way of doing it is good
for me.

<p> Another thing that I found surprising was that it is possible to build
Debian non-bloated. I'm planning on writing more about this at a later
date. I often hear people complain that Debian is bloated, but Arch
equally uses pre-compiled binary packages like Debian. The difference
is likely that Debian guesses what packages you want -- based on your
system install-time choices. So if you just choose "minimal" (or
whatever it's called) in the Debian installer, then you <i>will</i> get
a non-bloated, minimal Debian system that doesn't guess what packages you
want! This means that it is possible for Debian to attain an equal amount
of customizability as Arch.

<p>The most surprising thing I think is that it's possible to install
Debian the Arch Way -- where <i>you</i> are the installer. I haven't
actually tried it yet (I plan to -- and write about it). It's interesting
to note that this method of installation is actually outlined in <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/apds03.html.en">the
  Debian Manual</a>, even. I'm currently trying to find a good host live CD image to use as
the installer CD. Neither Debian Live nor Ubuntu live fit on a CD, and the 
Gentoo CD can't do anything until emerge-webrsync. Arch and Alpine might
be good choices; we'll see.

<p>A few other notes on Debian: avoid Frankendebian, it is apparently
possible (but difficult) to use other init systems as well as libcs,
and it's important to learn package pinning if you want rolling
yet stable.

<p>So, that was my story of how I figured out that Debian is indeed the
Universal Operating System. I'll probably write more about Debian.

<p>In any case, just remember to not switch distros just because you
think that the grass is greener on the other side. Remember that
your own distro is already very, very green. It just depends on how
you notice and utilize that greeness.

<p>Happy hacking!
