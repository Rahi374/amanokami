    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <!--

      <span># About me.</span>
    </div>
    -->
    
    <p> I am Paul Elder, a former IB diploma candidate in Japan. Now I am an undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Science.
    
    <p> My main system is a Lenovo LaVie Z, with Debian (Buster at the moment), lightdm, and i3-gaps. (2018-01-24) I have taken it as my goal to use Debian in such a way that I can claim it to be as KISS and customizable as Arch. After all, Debian <i>is</i> The Universal Operating System.
    
      <ul>
        <li> Text editor: Vim
        <li> Messager: pidgin/weechat
        <li> Email client: mutt + offlineimap
        <li> Web browser: qutebrowser
        <li> Terminal emulator: Terminator
        <li> Shell: zsh
        <li> Media: cmus
        <li> Input Method Manager: iBus
        <li> Network manager: NetworkManager
      </ul>
      
    <p> I started Debian when I was in 9th grade, back when Squeeze was the stable. Since then I've lived with Debian, though I switched to Arch for a year (11th grade) until the 10-year-old computer that I had it running on finally died. Then I got my current system.
      
    <p> My first language is Ruby, then C, HTML5+CSS3+JS, Emacs-Lisp, and bash. I am also fluent in LaTeX. I can do Java and Python as well, but I would rather not.  
    
    <p> I can also disarm a tar bomb in under ten seconds! <a href="https://xkcd.com/1168/">hehe :)</a>
      
    <p> My human languages consist of English, Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Spanish, in order of decreasing proficiency. I'm starting to lose my Spanish though :(
    
    <!--<p> I have experience with server administering, including Apache, Nginx, Ruby on Rails, Minecraft, SSH, git, <s>Tor</s>, <s>Squid</s>, OpenVPN, and <s>VNC</s>. <s>I'm planning to learn nodejs soon.</s> Update 
      
    <p> My IB courses were English A Language and Literature SL, Spanish B SL, Economics HL, Physics HL, Math ASL (+ AP Calculus BC), and Chemistry HL. I did my Extended Essay in Computer Science, investigating solving mazes using tree-searching algorithms.
        
    <p> My other passion is music. I have been playing the clarinet since 5th grade, and I obtained an Associate of Trinity College London (ATCL) Diploma. I also enjoy singing, though I am more of a clarinetist than a vocalist. I value musical expression a lot, and strongly believe that music is <b>a lot</b> more than just playing/singing the notes on the page. I like music theory as well, and can do simple composition (around 2 lines with a melody and bass line). Update 2017-05-11: I have taken a theory course at college! Now I can compuse 10-bar 4-voice chord transitions! More practically I do 2-voice short video game background music in some of my free time. I also do more voice and less clarinet now, which makes me sad considering all that I put into my clarinet.-->
    
      <h2>About Amanokami</h2>
    
      <h3>Amanokami</h3>
    
    <p> This original Amanokami was created in 2009 by the 6th grader me. It had that nice bright blue background of #0ff, Konata in the top left corner, and a few lightout games for entertainment.
    
    <p> I still remember back in 7th grade when we had to make a website in computer class; I was done as soon as it was assigned.
    
    <p> Of course, this version of the site never went online until many years later, around 2012 when I was in 8th or 9th grade.
    
      <h3>Amanokami Rebooted!</h3>
    
    <p> I thought that the original version looked pathetic, and I was too young to figure out makefiles and Rakefiles for templating the nav bar so I got lazy and turned the whole website into one page, with CSS/JS tabs.
    
    <p> This version went online in 2013 when I was in 10th grade. In 2014 this version of the site was lost to DigitalOcean, because I hadn't yet learned to have a local build of the site which I push to the server. 
    
      <h3>Amanokami 3</h3>
    
    <p> Instead of perpetually having the "Under Maintenance" and "I will not have time" signs on, I finally remodeled this site yet again on January 17th, 2015 (11th grade). This place looks so much nicer now.
    
      <h3>Amanokami Blog</h3>
    
    <p> Honestly, Amanokami 3 just had too much purple, and the instant you went mobile the navibar goes all "bleh" on you. I decided to switch to a blog (that generates more content, plus I have Emacs+IB to write about) and a simpler design. Also everything is done from Emacs and Org :)
    
      <h3>Amanokami Kai</h3>
    
    <p> Eventually the build system that org-page had broke on me and I ended up getting merge conflicts for no reason. It took me a year to get myself to rebuild the build system. (Completed 2017-05-03) Now it works nicely with Rake and ERBs! Although I need to look into a more... appropriate domain name for my Japanese audience. Update 2018-01-24: Still can't think of a good domain name.
