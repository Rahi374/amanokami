    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <!--
    <div class="code-container">
      <span># About me.</span>
    </div>
    -->
    
    <p> I am Paul Elder, a former IB diploma candidate in Japan. Now I am an undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Science.
    
    <p> My main system is a Lenovo LaVie Z, with Debian Jessie, gdm3, and i3.
    
      <ul>
        <li> Text editor: Emacs24
        <li> Messager: Pidgin
        <li> Web browser: Firefox Nightly
        <li> Terminal emulator: Terminator
        <li> Shell: bash
        <li> Media: Banshee
        <li> Input Method Manager: iBus
        <li> Network manager: NetworkManager
      </ul>
      
    <p> I started Debian when I was in 9th grade, back when Squeeze was the stable. Since then I've lived with Debian, though I switched to Arch for a year (11th grade) until the 10-year-old computer that I had it running on finally died. Then I got my current system.
      
    <p> My first language is Ruby, then C, HTML5+CSS3+JS, Emacs-Lisp, and bash. I am also fluent in LaTeX (though I struggle with BibLaTeX) and can also do OpenSCAD pretty well. I can do Java and Python as well, but I would rather not.
      
    <p> I can also disarm a tar bomb in under ten seconds! <a href="https://xkcd.com/1168/">hehe :)</a>
      
    <p> My human languages consist of English, Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Spanish, in order of decreasing proficiency. English and Japanese I can speak, read, write, and listen at a native level. Cantonese I can speak and listen at a native level, but read at an intermediate level. Mandarin and Spanish and I speak, read, write and listen at an intermediate level.
      
    <p> My IB courses were English A Language and Literature SL, Spanish B SL, Economics HL, Physics HL, Math ASL (+ AP Calculus BC), and Chemistry HL. I did my Extended Essay in Computer Science, investigating solving mazes using tree-searching algorithms.
      
    <p> I have experience with lots of server administering, including Apache, Ruby on Rails, Minecraft, Tor, Squid, VPN, and VNC (I took that down though). I'm planning to learn nodejs soon.
      
    <p> My other passion is music. I have been playing the clarinet since 5th grade, and I obtained an Associate of Trinity College London (ATCL) Diploma. I also enjoy singing, though I am more of a clarinetist than a vocalist. I value musical expression a lot, and strongly believe that music is <b>a lot</b> more than just playing/singing the notes on the page. I like music theory as well, and can do simple composition (around 2 lines with a melody and bass line).
    
      <h2>About Amanokami</h2>
    
      <h3>Amanokami</h3>
    
    <p> This original Amanokami was created in 2009 by the 6th grader me. It had that nice bright blue background of #0ff, Konata in the top left corner, and a few lightout games for entertainment.
    
    <p> I still remember back in 7th grade when we had to make a website in computer class, I was done as soon as it was assigned.
    
    <p> Of course, this version of the site never went online until many years later, around 2012 when I was in 8th or 9th grade.
    
      <h3>Amanokami Rebooted!</h3>
    
    <p> I thought that the original version looked pathetic, and I was too young to figure out makefiles and Rakefiles for templating the nav bar so I got lazy and turned the whole website into one page, with CSS/JS tabs.
    
    <p> This version went online in 2013 when I was in 10th grade. In 2014 this version of the site was lost to DigitalOcean, because I hadn't yet learned to have a local build of the site which I push to the server. (I'm still trying to get it back!)
    
      <h3>Amanokami 3</h3>
    
    <p> Instead of perpetually having the "Under Maintenance" and "I will not have time" signs on, I finally remodeled this site yet again on January 17th, 2015 (11th grade). This place looks so much nicer now.
    
      <h3>Amanokami Blog</h3>
    
    <p> Honestly, Amanokami 3 just had too much purple, and the instant you went mobile the navibar goes all "bleh" on you. I decided to switch to a blog (that generates more content, plus I have Emacs+IB to write about) and a simpler design. Also everything is done from Emacs and Org :)
